> **Cheaper & More Feature-Rich Alternative to Mailchimp** 
> I was a long-time Mailchimp user, but when their prices went up, I switched to Icegram. Icegram has more features than Mailchimp and is a fraction of the cost. I can email my members directly from my site and the plugin authors are great at support. I'm so glad I made the switch!
