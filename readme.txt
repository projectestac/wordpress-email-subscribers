### Experience the Magic of Lead Generation with Icegram Express: Hear from Our Satisfied Customers

* **Worked better than I’d hoped, once I set it up correctly**
> After being lazy for years and giving MailChimp WAY too much money, I’d finally had enough. I went on a search to find something like email subscribers and after reading the reviews I thought I’d give it a try. I don’t stay up to speed on all the technical bits of WordPress and run a simple site. I ran through all kinds of add ons and test programs to make Email Subscribers work, going further down a hole I didn’t want to be in. Then I finally just run Email Subscribers with a Cron job as it wanted me to do originally and Voila! It worked just fine. I cancelled all the add ons and just let it run natively and it is working exactly like I’d hoped for. I’m very pleased with the simplicity and ease of use. Great program.

* 👉 **I appreciate this free email list option** -
> I’ve been using this plugin for 4 years and it’s been working as it should without any problems. I’m so happy there is a free option available and when I get to sending more complicated marketing emails I probably will upgrade for more options.
> - [heidimaria](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-appreciate-this-free-email-list-option/)

* 👉 **Great plugin to compete with Mail Chimp** -
>  I had this plugin and when I started to install Mail Chimp to be able to contact my newsletter email list, I realized that I could do it from this plugin. Great for starting out and I look forward to using the pro version in the future!

* 👉 **Pro features in free edition**
>  I’m using this plugin for a couple free family blogs. I’m not going to spend money on a plugin for that so it’s very nice that they offer some great features in the free edition. I just use it to send out a notification when a new post is posted to the blogs. I do have to click through some of their upsell prompts from time to time but that’s a minor nuisance for such a well put together plugin. Everything just works! I can see where this would also allow people to try it out before purchasing a license to enable some of the more advanced features. I’ve been very happy with it so far. Thanks!
