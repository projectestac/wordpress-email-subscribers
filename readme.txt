> This works very well indeed... It **does all the necessary things for a newsletter/email list(s)**... **It is simple, clean, easy to engage, and looks good**... I was also easily able to do some styling on the input forms by adding its widget css into my child's style.css file and add and/or change some properties and values... Thanks much for making this available and staying on top of it... :-)

    ` [email-subscribers-form id="{form-id}"] `

*   **Widget option**

    Go to Appearance -> Widgets. Drag and drop the Email Subscribers widget to your desired location.

*   **Add directly in the theme**

    Add following line of PHP code directly in your theme :

    ` es_subbox( $namefield =  "YES", $desc = "", $group = "" ); `
